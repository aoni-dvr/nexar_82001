uststrap build flow:

1. Prepare the working .ini and put it in the folder config/
    The file name should indicate the DRAM type. For LPDDR4, it should contain "lpddr4". for LPDDR5, it should contain "lpddr5" 

2. Execute the helper script to generate the .ust for AmbaUSB and .bin for fastboot
    ./ust_gen_all.sh your_ini_name.ini

    To use with AmbaUSB, please copy the generated your_ini_name.ust to AmbaUSB's installation folder and add a new board file to use it.
    To use with fastboot, please copy the generated your_ini_name.bin to fastboot's folder and add a new bat file to use it.
